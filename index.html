				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
					This is the personal web site of David A. Matta. Obviously, I am still building the site. I am a Computer Scientist with 20+
					years experience in everything from mainframes, assembly language, and electronics to systems development in a wide range of
					programming languages. I am using this site as a way to refresh my skills in the latest development technologies and trends, as
					well as to showcase my work.

				<h3>What Am I Doing?</h3>
				<p>
					Over the past few years, I have really knocked the rust off of my developer and IT technical skills. Some examples of what I have done:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Obtained my AWS Developer Associate and AWS Solutions Architect Pro certificates.</li>
					<li>Refreshed my JavaScript development skills to include Node, React, and Next.js.</li>
					<li>Re-learned PHP and the Laravel framework (v11)</li>
					<li>Re-freshed my C programming skills, particularly on small devices like ESP-32 and Arduino boards.</li>
					<li>Build a small robot that uses MQTT and AWS IoT Core to send and receive information and instructions over the web.</li>
					<li>Become a bit of an expert on IoT, particularly in FreeRToS and AWS IoT.</li>
					<li>Switched my daily computer use from Windows to Ubuntu and Amazon Linux.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I also went from being a low level executive at Booz Allen Hamilton to a Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services, then moved into
					a management role at AWS, managing Solutions Architects supporting US Federal consultanting organizations. Duing this time, I have
					worked on a number of projects for the US Army and US Air Force, and the Department of Homeland Security.
				</p>
				<p>
					So what's next? I have a few ideas:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Learning Arch Linux</li>
					<li>New solutions for edge hardware, tied into AI learning</li>
					<li>Continue to expand my skills in non-industrial uses of IoT devices</li>
					<li>Finishing the new web site for <a href="www.xanodria.com">Xanodria Productions, Inc.</a></li>
					<li>Obtaining a few more AWS certificates and starting to learn Azure and Google Cloud Platform</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Finally, while I am currently employed, I am always interested in new opportunities. Message me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmatta">LinkedIn</a>
					if you have or know of an opportunity.

				<h3>Other Hobbies and Interests</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to my IT work, I also have a very wide range of hobbies that I love. I don't have enough time to do all of these regularly,
					but I would love to figure out how to do more of each.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Computer Gaming</li>
					<li>Live Action Roleplaying (LARP)</li>
					<li>3D Printing</li>
					<li>Computer Graphics/Video</li>
					<li>Private Pilot</li>
					<li>Environmental Issues</li>
					<li>Disney Addict</li>
				</ul>
