				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>This is the personal web site of David A. Matta. Obviously, I am still building the site. I am a Computer Scientist with 20+
				years experience in everything from mainframes, assembly language, and electronics to systems development in a wide range of
				programming languages. I am using this site as a way to refresh my skills in the latest development technologies and trends, as
				well as to showcase my work.</p>

				<h3>What Am I Doing?</h3>
				<p>So while I have 20+ years experience in a wide range of IT topics, I have spent the past few years in management and consulting,
				solution design, and enterprise architecture. This has meant that I missed several years of innovation and am a little rusty on
				modern systems are actually implemented at the developer level. This page and the projects I am working on the side are to both help
				me knock some of the rust off, learn new tools and techniques, and stay abreast of the details. Some examples of what I am currently
				exploring are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using modern tools like Git/GitHub, Visual Studio 2017, Anaconda, Eclipse, etc.</li>
					<li>Using new languages and later versions of languages I currently know, including Python, R, .Net Core, Java etc.</li>
					<li>Implementing modern concepts like Responsive Design, Microservice Architecture, Deep Learning, and DevOps Pipelines.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation tasks and technologies that I commonly espouse at the strategic
				and enterprise levels so that I can better work the full range and stack of issues for my clients. I also hope to be able to work
				at any level in any project that I am interested in.</p>

				<h3>Other Hobbies and Interests</h3>
				<p>In addition to my IT work, I also have a very wide range of hobbies that I love. I don't have enough time to do all of these regularly,
				but I would love to figure out how to do more of each.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Computer Gaming</li>
					<li>Live Action Roleplaying (LARP)</li>
					<li>3D Printing</li>
					<li>Computer Graphics/Video</li>
					<li>Private Pilot</li>
					<li>Environmental Issues</li>
					<li>Disney Addict</li>
